I am a PhD Student at the [Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)](https://www.tuwien.at/), advised by [Matteo Maffei](https://secpriv.tuwien.ac.at/team/matteo_maffei/) and [Georg Weissenbacher](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/georg-weissenbacher) in the [Security and Privacy](https://secpriv.wien/) group.

My research interests focus on the *Formal Verification of Neural Networks*, aiming to ensure the safety and reliability of machine learning systems. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Scientist in the Software Reliability Section at Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), Mumbai. I did my masters thesis titled #Scalable Formal Verification Techniques for Model-Based Design Frameworks# under Dr. Ajith John while working at BARC. In 2024, I was a Summer Intern at *Amazon Web Services* in the USA.
